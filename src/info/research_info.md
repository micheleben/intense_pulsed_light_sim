# IPL tubes

Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) tubes, also known as xenon flashlamps, are specialized gas discharge lamps that emit high-intensity, broad-spectrum light pulses. They are widely used in cosmetic and medical applications, particularly for hair removal, skin rejuvenation, and treatment of vascular and pigmented lesions. IPL tubes operate by passing a high-voltage electrical pulse through a xenon gas-filled tube, producing a bright flash of light that is filtered to target specific chromophores in the skin.

- Pulse configuration: Multi-pulse trains (2-15 pulses)

## Technology difference btw budget and premium lamps

### Material quality determines lifespan:
The critical differentiator between budget ($0.36) and premium ($190) lamps lies in three factors:

1. Quartz envelope quality – Clear-Fused-Quartz (CFQ) manufactured manually at higher fusion temperatures provides superior UV transmission (down to 220nm), explosion resistance, and thermal stability. Budget lamps use borosilicate glass.

2. Electrode materials – Premium lamps use barium tungsten cathodes with low work function and high electron emission. Ctia Budget lamps use pure tungsten. Electrode tips operate at 1,800-3,400°C during firing.
3. Xenon gas purity – Industrial applications use 99.995% purity; semiconductor-grade 99.999% commands significant premiums.
